# Bankist | When banking meets minimalist | Demo Project

A full fledged banking application. I have implemented the login and sign up feature as you see in digital banks in reality. Though this banking application does'nt have a database or a server to store the user's data like their username, password and their account transaction details, I have pre defined users details like their username, password and transaction details in a object. You can't create a digital account or signup right now. As of now i have defined 4 users details. You can login with their username and password, to see how the application really works. Here is the details 👇🏼

Account 1:
username: "rs"
password: 1111

Account 2:
username: "jd"
password: 2222

Account 3:
username: "stw"
password: 3333

Account 4:
username: "ss"
password: 4444

You can login, with this login credentials. Thanks!
